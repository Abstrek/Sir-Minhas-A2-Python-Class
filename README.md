# Sir-Minhas-A2-Python-Class
This is a student created repo for Sir Minhas's python class. I hope this repo is of help if you were either absent or just need a refresher. Please correct any mistakes that you spot and raise it in the issues section. 

The repository structure is as follows:- 
```
  - Date of the class
    - First program
    - Second program
    - Third program
    - Readme.md (ignore this it is just the text you see below the files".
```
And so on for other files. 

### If you have any queries or doubts raise it in the issues section, and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.
