# Sir-Minhas-A2-Python-Class
This is a student created repo for Sir Minhas's python class. I hope this repo serves you well if you were absent or just need a refresher. Please correct any mistakes that you spot and raise it as an issue in the issues section. 

```
The repository structure is as follows:- 
  - Date of the class
    - First program
    - Second program
    - Third program
    - Pdf copy of the notes that I have made
    - Readme.md (ignore this)
```
And so on for other files. If you have any queries or doubts raise it in the issues section, and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.
