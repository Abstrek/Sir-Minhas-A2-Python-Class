### Basic Mathematical and Comparision operators
---

 - DIV/Quotient can be found using `//`. Usage example:- 
 ```python
 # To find the DIV of 3/2 use
 x = 3 // 2
 ```
- MOD/Remainder can be found using `%`. Usage example:- 
```python
# To find the MOD of 3/2 use 
x = 3 % 2
```

 - To check if a certain value `x` is equal to y, during a comparision in `IF` or `WHILE` use  `==` like this:- 
```python
if(x == y):
	#Something happens
```

- For assignment. Lets say I want `x` to have the value of `y`, we use `=`  use it like this :-
```python
x = y 
``` 

### Input
---
Input always gives a string you need to typecast it to other by writing: 
```python
# We typecast the string given by input to an integer here. 
x = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
```

### range command
---
Usage: 
```python
range(intial count, (final count - 1), step)
```
"Intial Count" is zero by default and "step" is one by default
